## Inputs

| Field | Type | Source | Required | Validation |
|-------|------|--------|----------|------------|
| specialist_output | string | Specialist agent | Yes | Non-empty deliverable |
| original_request | string | User prompt | Yes | The original request that triggered the work |
| specialist_id | string | Routing | Yes | Agent ID that produced the output |

---

## Preconditions

- Specialist has completed their task and produced output
- Output quality checklist is available at checklists/output-quality.md

---

## Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Understand Context

1. Re-read the original user request
2. Identify what was asked vs what was delivered
3. Note the specialist who produced the output
4. Identify the movement stage: ignition, growth, institutionalization
5. Determine the deliverable type: manifesto, community strategy, mobilization plan, identity framework

### Phase 2: Apply Quality Checklist

1. Load checklists/output-quality.md
2. Evaluate each item against the specialist output
3. Mark each item: [x] Pass, [ ] Fail, [N/A] Not Applicable
4. Count CRITICAL failures and total failures
5. Pay special attention to: tension clarity, identity resonance, call to action specificity, and impact measurability

### Phase 3: Score and Decide

| Score | Verdict | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| All CRITICAL pass, < 2 non-critical fail | APPROVE | Deliver to user |
| All CRITICAL pass, 2+ non-critical fail | REVISE | Return to specialist with specific feedback |
| Any CRITICAL fail | REJECT | Return to specialist, block delivery |

### Phase 4: Output

Produce review report with verdict, score, and feedback.
